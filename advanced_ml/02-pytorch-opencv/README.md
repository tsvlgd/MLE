## About this folder

This directory demonstrates combining PyTorch deep learning workflows with OpenCV-based computer vision tools. It contains examples and notebooks that show how to prepare image data, build and train models in PyTorch, and apply inference and post-processing using OpenCV.

### What you'll find here
- Example notebooks and scripts for model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- Utilities for dataset preparation, augmentation, and image I/O.
- Demos showing real-time or batch inference with OpenCV image processing.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with PyTorch and OpenCV installed.
- Common ML libraries (numpy, torchvision, matplotlib). See requirements.txt if present.

### Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Explore the notebooks for data preparation and training steps.
3. Run provided inference scripts to see model outputs processed with OpenCV.

This folder is intended for learning and prototyping PyTorch + OpenCV pipelines; adapt the examples to your dataset and model architecture.

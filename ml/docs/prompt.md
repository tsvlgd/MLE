“I want you to explain concepts from the very first principles. For each topic:

Start by defining what it is and why it is needed.

Explain what was done before this technique existed and the limitations of those approaches.

Describe what motivated the adoption of this technique and what problems it solved.

Break down how it actually works, including system-level explanations and step-by-step logic.

Use a common, consistent example throughout the explanation to illustrate each point clearly.

Highlight the impact or advantages it brought to the field.

Explain in a way that builds intuition, not just formulas.”

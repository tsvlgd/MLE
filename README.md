# MLE Learning Journey

This repo captures my from-scratch path into Machine Learning Engineering. Instead of jumping straight into high-level libraries, I'm building up core algorithms, vectorized logic, and practical intuition one step at a time.

It's less about wrapping functions and more about understanding what happens under the hood—whether it's computing covariance, PCA, or building models manually. Every script reflects real learning moments, mistakes included.

This isn’t a course, it’s the process—raw, experimental, and meant to build deep confidence before scaling up into production-level ML.
